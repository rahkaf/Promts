Guide: Laguna S 2.1

Another Model always fun! And open source, touted to be;

>The West's most capable open-weight model

**Consensus:** *Essentially uncensored, didn't get a refusal across any harm category *

## Jailbreaking The Model

*Simply Copy and Paste the following into plain chat or system prompt area;*

*Might be overkill for such a small LLM, but whatever, it's always on my clipboard*

## Thoughts

I am a huge fan of open source LLMs, no matter the quality, I don't care about East vs West or China vs America, I use whatever is best imo to price to cost ratio. I have a myriad of agents running, so depending on the job this could be a decent replacement for one of the lesser ones.

Haven't received my opinion about its coding capabilities yet from the greatest AI YouTuber **[Bijan Bowen](https://youtube.com/@bijanbowen?si=higYkMOBBC8tFW4K)**

So who is to say.

 As for writing it does a decent job, I haven't tested long form content, but one shot stories it provides adequate detail, I'd say it beats out a lot of these flash models we have been seeing.

The model is kinda dumb if not using thinking mode, it can go into circular reasoning, have to explain or request things a couple times.
