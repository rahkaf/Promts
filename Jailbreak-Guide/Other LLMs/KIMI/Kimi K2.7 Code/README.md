# Kimi K2.7 Jailbreak Guide

My favorite model **Kimi K2.6** is getting an upgrade to **Kimi K2.7**, this is only the code focused version so far.

It's available via API only for now, can use on Openrouter or set up your own interface.

Still writes peak, and its coding capabilities are definitely upgraded.

Available only via API alone for now, can use pretty much anything, was using this mostly;

# Thoughts

Any open source upgrade is needed, we need to propel it as much as possible. Waiting on the full release for my actual thoughts, but if this snapshot is anything, I'm wowed.
