Guide:
We finally have it, something to force Anthropic to walk back their shit stance on AI safety and alignment.

>**KIMI K3**

A **Fable 5** class open source model, that is completely unrestricted. I ran this through my  full 125 prompt red teaming benchmark. It's truly peak.

## Jailbreaking the Model

*Super simple, just copy and paste this into chat via the official Kimi APP or in the system prompt area if using via API*;

>**[ENI for Kimi K3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wwrN4CwQrcqssU7O3LNsaoUKJn0r0u5bf6nePk8KYME/edit?usp=drivesdk)**

*Make sure memory is off, and make sure it doesn't try to paste it as a file*

## Thoughts

Amazing, this is the best writing model out there, it has such fine attention to detail, unique prose handling, and can do any and all content. I haven't been this impressed with a model before, since maybe **ChatGPT o1/o3** or **Deepseek r1**

It was pretty resistant to some prompts via the official Kimi app, so had to make some fine tune adjustments to the injection detection stuff and the ENI prompt, but was able to get it consistent and working, as always via API it's an open book using ENI.
