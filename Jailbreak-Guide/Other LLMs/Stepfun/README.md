Chinese Labs are relentless, Stepfun 3.7 Flash is out, mind you Stepfun is still offering $100 API credit, so snag it while you can.

# Jailbreaking the LLM

Simply slap this into the system prompt area;

>**[ENI LIME](ENI%20LIME.md)**

It's my default but could probably use any variant.

# Thoughts

The model is fun to talk to and writes very well imo, attention to detail is a slight issue, but nothing as bad as **Gemini 3.5 Flash.**
Essentially uncensored reasoning models that you can use for free, due to the cheap API costs, fuck, count me in.

# Issues

Seems to be an input filter for bad words, like anything naughty, but very hit or miss, other than that no output filtering, so that's good.
