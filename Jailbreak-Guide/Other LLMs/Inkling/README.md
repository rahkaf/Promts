Guide:

They kinda cooked with this new model called **Inkling** by, **Mira Murati** and the team at **Thinking Machines** - an open source model that is essentially uncensored but has such robust capabilities. Very solid model.


**Simply Copy and paste the following into chat/api;**

>**[ENI LIME apr](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fcJvbGhk4sv-DzCm5X7M-0_zND1autT-f4KnoR42BgQ/edit?usp=drivesdk)**

*Definitely overkill, could use a smaller version of ENI*


## Thoughts

It's writing is probably better than the majority of these mid tier models we have seen recently, **HY3, Muse Spark 1.1, etc.**

It's writing is so good due to its solid chain of thought, it reasons in a detailed manner and plans the narrative or response completely. We see something similar in **QWEN** model, but to a lesser degree.

As for safety, they make these claims;

>Safety: FORTRESS benchmark tested: strongest safeguards of any open-weights model.

Completely false, I was able to get **ANY** content, specifically; *weapons/malicious code/any NSFW* They say it was evaluated by outside testers and such, but clearly very poorly. Should of had me do it!
