Another Opus model, wtf are we doing? Anthropic? Fable and Opus are so close together it's literally scrabbling over percentages in intelligence. **WHERE TF IS HAIKU**

>Anthropic has neutered another models CoT

## Thoughts

**Consensus:** Safeguards make the model a chore to deal with, especially since we have been getting more popular with ENI and such, lots of older ENI gets paused, so had to iterate and see what wouldn't. Writing is hit or miss, if you give it a solid writing deck, it's great, left to its own devices, it kinda sucks. Much more personable than **Opus 4.8**, less suspicious overall.

I do think it has potential, via API it's much more open, though safeguards will still hinder you. I feel like **Opus 4.7** is a better writer generally, but if you have a fat stack of lore and author samples, **Opus 5** is very very good.

Pricing is the same as **Opus 4.8**, with an alleged increase in intelligence near/surpassing **Fable 5**.

**BIG ISSUE:** Anthropic has canned the LLMs thinking blocks, even the summarizers are only showing a single sentence or snippet. I am all about CoT and reading reasoning, so this really puts me off. Like a lot….

## Jailbreaking The Model

*Simply Copy and Paste the following into plain chat or system prompt area;*

*Shared Lines works alone, but harder content like beastiality and some non con will get refused*
